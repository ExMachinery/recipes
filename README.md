So, im russian refuge and im learning to code so i dont have to return back to "Motherland". Hope you dont hate me, cause im strongly against war, lost almost everything i had, but never supported Putin. I duno why im saying this, perhaps because i want to say something meaningful in my first Readme to my first project. This is "Readme" after all, so why not actually read me in some weird manner, huh?

In this project ill try to use all kind of skills i learned through my first steps in Odin Project. In this case im using html to create recipes website and upgrade it with css in future. Ill use git for managing my work and also mostly will use bash to operate my work environment around code itself. Also im using VSCode to write my things.

Also ill try to make this website somehow useful for myself. Im lacking any meaningful cooking skills, so i will be searching for simple, but somewhat healthy food and store recipes + video guides from Youtube here (need to find, how to insert youtube link to my website). Furthermore, in future i want to create some kind of food supply tracking system, which will providing me with information about food shortages in my fridge, so i could recognize and resupply it with ease.

Oh, and my English writing is awful, so ill practice it. 

Good Luck me. Cheers
